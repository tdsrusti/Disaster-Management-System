üí≥ **Donation Processing**: Seamless integration with Stripe for secure donations

üåç **Resource Mapping**: Interactive maps for locating shelters, medical centers, and aid resources

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project requires the following dependencies:

- **Programming Language**: JavaScript (Node.js)
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Runtime Environment**: Node.js (v14 or higher)

### Installation

   cd Disaster-Management-System
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your configuration:
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_token
   ```

## Usage
